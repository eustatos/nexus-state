     * Negative: Risk of breaking existing functionality

2. **Review and verify existing implementation (CHOSEN)**
   * **Reasoning:** Task file may be outdated
   * **Implications:**
     * Positive: No duplicate work
     * Positive: Verify existing code quality
     * Positive: Update task status accurately
